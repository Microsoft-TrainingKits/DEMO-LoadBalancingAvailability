# Load Balancing and Availability Sets #

In this demo, you will demonstrate how easy it is to set up load-balancing between two Web servers. 

You will also demonstrate how to configure an Availability set for two Web servers to ensure high availability.

The demo starts by creating two new Windows Server 2012 VMs. After starting the provisioning, you must wait 4-5 minutes before the two servers are provisioned and running.

> **Note:** To avoid a pause in the demo or exiting back to slides while the Virtual Machines provision, it is strongly encouraged to provision at least the first VM of the load balanced set.

## Demo ##

1. In a Windows Azure PowerShell window, type the following commands:

	````PowerShell
	$svcname = "ITC-" + $(Get-Random -Minimum 10000 -Maximum 99999)

	$vmimage = "MSFT__Windows-Server-2012-Datacenter-201210.01-en.us-30GB.vhd"

	$iisvm1 = New-AzureVMConfig -Name "iisvm1" -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $vmimage | Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -Password "Passw0rd!"

	$iisvm2 = New-AzureVMConfig -Name "iisvm2" -InstanceSize Small -ImageName $vmimage | Add-AzureProvisioningConfig -Windows -Password "Passw0rd!"

	New-AzureVM -ServiceName $svcname -VMs $iisvm1, $iisvm2 -Location "LOCATION"
	````

	> **Note:** It will take a few minutes for the two new VMs to be provisioned and running._

	> We start by creating a random name for a cloud service. The name must be unique (<name>.cloudapp.net), so we use a random number to ensure it does not exist yet.

	> The image name is an Azure-provide  **Windows Server 2012** image. You can find all existing image names by using the following PowerShell command:
Get-AzureVMImage | ft ImageName

	> The last three commands create a cloud service with two new VMs, based on the Windows Server 2012 image.

	> - **Note**: Make sure the specified **LOCATION** matches the datacenter that the storage account is created in. For example "West US".

	> - **Note**: These commands require a default storage account name. You can set that with the PowerShell command:
Set-AzureSubscription "<subname>" 
-CurrentStorageAccount "<storagename>"

1. Notice that you can follow the progresss of the PowerShell command execution on the screen.

	> After the VMs are created, they  are starting up. This may take two minutes or so.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Virtual Machines** page, click he **iisvm1** name.

	![Provisioning Virtual Machines](./Images/Provisioning-Virtual-Machines.png?raw=true "Provisioning Virtual Machines")

	> Even though the VMs are still being starting, we can already examine their network properties.

1. On the iisvm1 page, examine the information under **Quick Glance**. Click the back button to go back to the **Virtual Machines** page.

	> Notice the public IP address, and the internal (private) IP address of the starting VM. 

	> Azure assigns the private IP address to the VM, as soon as it is started.

1. On the Virtual Machines page, wait until both **iisvm1** and **iisvm2** are running. Select **iisvm1**, and then on the toolbar, click **Connect**. Open the RDP connection, and log on with credentials **Administrator / Passw0rd!**.

	![Connecting to the IISVM1 VM](./Images/Connecting-to-the-IISVM1-VM.png?raw=true "Connecting to the IISVM1 VM")

	> First let's connect to the first server to enable IIS.

1. In iisvm1, open the the **Windows PowerShell** window,
and then run the command:

	````PowerShell
Install-WindowsFeature -Name  Web-WebServer
```

	![Installing IIS using PowerShell](./Images/Installing-IIS-using-PowerShell.png?raw=true "Installing IIS using PowerShell")

	> Let's use PowerShell to install the Web Server (IIS) on the first server. 

	> While the role is installed, we can go to the second server.

1. In the Azure portal, select **iisvm2**, and then on the toolbar, click **Connect**. Open the RDP connection, and log on with credentials **Administrator / Passw0rd!**.

	![Connecting to the IISVM2 VM](./Images/Connecting-to-the-IISVM2-VM.png?raw=true "Connecting to the IISVM2 VM")
	
	> We also need to connect to the second server to enable IIS.

1. In iisvm2, in Server Manager, click **Add roles and features**. In the wizard, on the **Server Roles** page, select **Web Server (IIS)**, choose "**Add Features**", and keep clicking **Next** and then finally click **Install** to complete the wizard.

	![Adding roles to the VM using the Azure Portal](./Images/Adding-roles-to-the-VM-using-the-Azure-Portal.png?raw=true "Adding roles to the VM using the Azure Portal")

	> In the second server, let's use Server Manager to install the Web Server.

	> While the role installed, we can enable load-balancing on the two VMs.

1. In the Windows Azure PowerShell window, type the following commands:

	````Powershell
	Get-AzureVM -ServiceName $svcname -Name "iisvm1" | `
	Add-AzureEndPoint -Name "Web" `
		-Protocol "tcp" `
		-PublicPort 80 `
		-LocalPort 80 `
		-LBSetName "Web" `
		-ProbePort 80 `
		-ProbeProtocol "http" `
		-ProbePath "/" | `
	Update-AzureVM
	````

	> On the first server, we use Azure PowerShell to add the **Endpoint** for port 80. This will direct incoming traffic on a public port to a private port on the VM.
This is called **port forwarding**.

	> Notice that we provided a name for the Endpoint (**Web**), and a name for the load-balancing set (**Web**).

	> After this command, only the first server has the Endpoint defined. We also need to add the Endpoint to the second server.

1. In the Azure portal, on the Virtual machines page, click the **iisvm2** name. On the iisvm2 page, on the **Endpoints** tab, click the **Add Endpoint** icon.

	![Azure Portal - Adding an Endpoint](./Images/Azure-Portal---Adding-an-Endpoint.png?raw=true "Azure Portal - Adding an Endpoint")

	>Let's use the Azure portal to add the Endpoint to the second server.

1. In the wizard, select Load-balance traffic on existing endpoint. In the drop-down list box, select **Web**. Click the right arrow icon to continue.

	![Adding a Web Endpoint](./Images/Adding-a-Web-Endpoint.png?raw=true "Adding a Web Endpoint")

	> **Note:** if the **Web** entry does not appear, then the endpoint has not finished configuring yet on iisvm1.

	> Instead of adding an independent endpoint, we will load-balance on an existing endpoint, with load-balancing set name **Web**.

1. Specify the following details:
	- Name: **Web**
	- Protocol: **TCP** (grayed out)
	- Public Port: **80** (grayed out)
	- Private Port: **80**

	Click the check mark icon  to continue.

	![Propagating Endpoint configuration to VMs](./Images/Propagating-Endpoint-configuration-to-VMs.png?raw=true "Propagating Endpoint configuration to VMs")

	> When specifying the load-balanced endpoint, notice that the Protocol (TCP) and the Public Port (80) cannot be changed.
       
	> Also notice that you can change the private port if the other server was listening to web traffic on a separate port.  Ideally this will be the same port and this is what we are using, so we will choose port 80 for the private port.
	
	> As soon as you add it, you can see that it says "yes" under load balanced for this endpoint.

	> Before testing the new configuration, let's update the IIS header inside the VMs so we know which web server we are hitting when we load balance.

1. Switch to the existing RDP connection to **iisvm1**. Close the Windows PowerShell window.

	![Web Server IIS Successfully installed](./Images/Web-Server-IIS-Successfully-installed.png?raw=true "Web Server IIS Successfully installed")
